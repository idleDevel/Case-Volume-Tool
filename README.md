# Case-Volume-Tool
Summary:
A portable Pywebview app for helping quickly define case volume for design considerations. 

This tool started out a widget to help with my personal case design projects. It would have been easy enough to just use spreadsheets, but I found this was a good programming exercise and enabled me to more easily adjust values with my CAD pulled up. The "Always on top" functionality is pretty clutch.
